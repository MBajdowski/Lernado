### **Lernado - the eLearning Platform**
## About
The aim of our Bachelor Degree work “E-Learning Platform” is to deliver fully functional and easy in deploy e-learning web application, which will be innovativ on the market and will fulfill the customer's needs or demands. Moreover we would like to prepare a document presenting our results and describe the steps we took to prepare it - starting from the theoretical basics, through technical analysis, ending with testing the program and summary. 

This github repository is the fulfillment of the project itself

## eLearning in general

_"The delivery of a learning, training or education program by electronic means."_ ~Derek Stockley

**LMS and Building Blocks**  
While designing Lernado, we focused on following two stategies: 
* LMS - a framework, that is taking care of the whole learning process starting with identifying personal training goals and ending with supervising and reporting the process. It also handles registration for courses and course administration.
* Building Block - a small portion of knowlage which is: self-contained, reusable and can be aggregated

## Technology overview
In order to make Lernado innovativ and easy to deploy we tried to use most recent technology:
* Java 8
* Spring MVC
* Spring Security
* Spring Boot
* Hibernate
* My SQL/H2
* JSP
* JMS
* REST
